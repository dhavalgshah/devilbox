phpMyAdmin

columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) can be performed via the user interface,
while you still have the ability to directly execute any SQL statement.


Adminer

`Adminer <https://www.adminer.org/>`_ (formerly phpMinAdmin) is a full-featured database
management tool written in PHP. Conversely to phpMyAdmin, it consist of a single file ready to
deploy to the target server. Adminer is available for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS SQL,
Oracle, Firebird, SimpleDB, Elasticsearch and MongoDB.


OpcacheGUI
----------

`OpcacheGui <https://github.com/amnuts/opcache-gui>`_ is a clean and responsive interface for
Zend OPcache information, showing statistics, settings and cached files, and providing a real-time
update for the information (using jQuery and React).
