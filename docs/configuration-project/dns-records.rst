DNS records
***********

Project DNS records are required, because each project is using its own virtual host with its own
unique server name.

The server name is constructed by a ``<project-directory>`` and the :ref:`env_tld_suffix` and
requires the same DNS record to be present in order to access it.

.. seealso::
    This section gives you an overview about how to create separate DNS records for each project.
    It has to be done for each project, however if you want to automate the process, refer
    to :ref:`global_configuration_auto_dns`.

Examples
========

In order to better illustrate the process, we are going to use two projects as an example.
See the following table for project directories and TLD_SUFFIX.

+-------------------+------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+
| Project directory | TLD_SUFFIX | Project URL              | Required DNS name     |
+===================+============+==========================+=======================+
| project-1         | ``loc``    | http://project-1.loc     | ``project-1.loc``     |
+-------------------+------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+
| www.project-1     | ``loc``    | http://www.project-1.loc | ``www.project-1.loc`` |
+-------------------+------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+

.. note::
    When you have created the above two projects, you can check the vhost page on the
    Devilbox intranet. It will tell you exactly what DNS record to add.

.. important:: The IP address ``127.0.0.1`` is different for :ref:`docker_toolbox`


Creating DNS records
====================

When creating DNS records for your host operating system, there are two distinctions to be made.
If you use Native Docker (the default and recommended Docker), you can always use ``127.0.0.1``
as your IP address for the DNS record. If however your use Docker Toolbox, you first need to
find out the IP address of the Docker Toolbox virtual machine.

.. seealso:: :ref:`docker_toolbox`


Native Docker
-------------

Linux
^^^^^

Use your favorite editor and open ``/etc/hosts`` with root privileges. The following example
uses vim to add the two example DNS records.

.. code-block:: bash

    host> sudo vim /etc/hosts

    127.0.0.1 project-1.loc
    127.0.0.1 www.project-1.loc


MacOS
^^^^^

Use your favorite editor and open ``/etc/hosts`` with root privileges. The following example
uses vim to add the two example DNS records.

.. code-block:: bash

    host> sudo vim /etc/hosts

    127.0.0.1 project-1.loc
    127.0.0.1 www.project-1.loc


Windows
^^^^^^^

On Windows you need to open ``C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`` with administrative privileges
and add the following two lines:

.. code-block:: bash

    127.0.0.1 project-1.loc
    127.0.0.1 www.project-1.loc


Docker Toolbox
--------------

When using Docker Toolbox the Devilbox runs inside a virtual machine and therefore the webserver
port (80) is not exposed to your host operating system. So your DNS record must point to the
virtual machine instead of your host system.

1. Find out the IP address the virtual machine is running on
2. Add a DNS entry to your host operating system for this IP address.

For the sake of this example, letâ€™s assume the virtual machine is running on ``192.16.0.1``


MacOS
^^^^^

Use your favorite editor and open ``/etc/hosts`` with root privileges. The following example
uses vim to add the two example DNS records.

.. code-block:: bash

    host> sudo vim /etc/hosts

    192.16.0.1 project-1.loc
    192.16.0.1 www.project-1.loc


Windows
^^^^^^^

On Windows you need to open ``C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`` with administrative privileges
and add the following two lines:

.. code-block:: bash

    192.16.0.1 project-1.loc
    192.16.0.1 www.project-1.loc



Verify
======

After settings the DNS records, you can use the ``ping`` command to verify if everything works.

.. code-block:: bash

    host> ping -c1 project-1.loc

    PING project-1.loc (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.066 ms

.. code-block:: bash

    host> ping -c1 www.project-1.loc

    PING www.project-1.loc (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.066 ms
